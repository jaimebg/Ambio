Ambio combines focus timers with immersive ambient soundscapes to help you achieve deep work and concentration.

Unlike basic timer apps, Ambio creates a complete sensory environment. When you select rain, the entire interface shifts to calming cool blues. Choose fireplace, and warm oranges embrace you. This dynamic theming reduces visual distractions and keeps you in flow.

FOCUS TIMER
Use proven Pomodoro technique presets (25 or 50 minutes) for structured work sessions. A gentle chime signals completion without jarring you out of focus. Perfect for studying, writing, coding, or any task requiring sustained attention.

AMBIENT MODE
Not timing a session? Switch to ambient mode for continuous soundscape playback. Ideal for relaxation, meditation, reading, or falling asleep to calming sounds.

5 HANDCRAFTED SOUNDSCAPES
- Rain: Gentle rain on a window for concentration
- Fireplace: Crackling warmth for cozy focus

- Ocean: Rhythmic waves for calm energy
- Cave: Echoing cave ambiance for deep contemplation
