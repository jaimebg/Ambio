   Data extraction rules for Android 12+ (API 31+) cloud backup.
   Defines what data should be included/excluded from device-to-device transfers
   and cloud backups.

   For Ambio, we:
   - Include DataStore preferences (user settings like volume, last sound, mode)
   - Include Room database (session history)
   - Exclude cache files
