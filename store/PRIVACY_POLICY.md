# Privacy Policy for Ambio

**Last updated:** January 26, 2025

## Overview

Ambio ("the App") is developed by JBGSoft. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use our focus timer application.

**The short version:** Ambio does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The app works entirely offline and all data stays on your device.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any information.**

Ambio is designed with privacy as a core principle:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No crash reporting to external services
- No advertising or ad tracking
- No account creation required
- No network requests are made

## Data Stored on Your Device

Ambio stores the following data locally on your device only:

1. **User Preferences**
   - Selected soundscape
   - Volume level
   - Timer duration preference
   - Mode preference (timer/ambient)

2. **Session History**
   - Completed focus session timestamps
   - Session durations

This data is stored using Android's standard storage mechanisms (DataStore and Room database) and never leaves your device. You can clear this data at any time through your device's app settings.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Permissions

Ambio requests the following Android permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Foreground Service | To continue playing audio when the app is minimized |
| Media Playback | To play ambient sounds in the background |
| Post Notifications | To show media controls (Android 13+) |
| Vibrate | To provide haptic feedback on interactions |
| Wake Lock | To keep audio playing when screen is off |

None of these permissions are used to collect or transmit data.

## Children's Privacy

Ambio does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The app is safe for all ages.

## Data Security

Since no data is collected or transmitted, there is no risk of data breach from our servers. All locally stored preferences use Android's secure storage mechanisms.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Open Source

Ambio is open source software licensed under the MIT License. You can review the complete source code to verify our privacy practices:
